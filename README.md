CtrlLights is an AI-powered traffic management solution designed to reduce congestion and pollution. By integrating cameras, sensors, and a deep learning algorithm, it analyzes real-time data to optimize traffic light timings, cutting wait times and easing flow. The dedicated web platform and mobile app provide seamless control and monitoring for operators and users alike. Early statistics indicate potential reductions of up to 25% in travel time, 21% in emissions, and notable fuel savings. With plans to expand into more locations and integrate with broader smart city initiatives, CtrLights paves the way for safer, greener, and more efficient roads.
