CtrLight – Intelligent Traffic Management System
📌 Description

CtrLight is an AI-powered solution for adaptive traffic light control, designed to reduce congestion, minimize emissions, and shorten travel times. By integrating cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms, it analyzes real-time traffic data to dynamically optimize traffic signals and ensure smoother road conditions.
🎯 Goals

    Reduce Traffic Congestion – Automatically adjust traffic lights based on live traffic flow.
    Improve Air Quality – Lower emissions by minimizing idle time and stop-and-go driving.
    Create a Centralized Platform – Provide a web and mobile interface for monitoring and controlling traffic signals.
    Adaptive Self-Learning – Continuously refine the AI model using real-time data to enhance performance.

🔨 Main Development Stages

    Research & Planning – Analyze existing adaptive traffic systems and define core functionalities.
    Architecture Design – Split the project into modules (data collection, AI model, traffic light control).
